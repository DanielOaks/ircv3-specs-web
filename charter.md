# Charter

---

The IRCv3 working group is chartered to prototype, develop and test further incremental changes to
the IRC client protocol.  It does not define any other aspect of an IRC network, such as IRC services,
or the server-to-server protocol, although the changes it develops may require cooperation from vendors
in both areas.

## Participation

Interested stakeholders are encouraged to participate in the group.  We consider stakeholders to be:

 * Developers of IRC daemons which are actively used;
 * Developers of IRC clients with widespread usage;
 * Developers of other software relating to the IRC ecosystem with widespread usage
   (such as IRC services, bots, bouncers, libraries);
 * Developers from IRC networks greater than 1,000 active at-peak users which have adopted
   the IRCv3 specifications.

Other users may participate in the group in a semi-moderated fashion.  We encourage developers of new
software relating to IRC to participate in the public resources.

## Resources

 * The [ircv3/ircv3-specifications](https://github.com/ircv3/ircv3-specifications) Github repository and issue tracker.  The Github repository is the
   official repository containing the latest version of the official specifications.  Changes are to
   be submitted using a pull request.  We request that pull requests not be submitted to social
   media aggregators, as we have no mechanism to moderate the bug tracker efficiently.

 * The [#ircv3](irc://irc.freenode.net/ircv3) channel at [irc.freenode.net](irc://irc.freenode.net/ircv3).  This is the main public space for the working group.
   You are required to follow specific rules to participate in this IRC channel, else you may be
   removed at any time.

 * The [#ircv3-dev](irc://irc.freenode.net/ircv3-dev) channel at [irc.freenode.net](irc://irc.freenode.net/ircv3-dev).  This is a read-only channel, where the only
   participants allowed to write to it are active stakeholders as described above.  The same rules
   apply to `#ircv3-dev` that apply to `#ircv3`.

## Ground Rules

To ensure smooth operations of the working group, we request that:

 * Participants assume good faith from other participants.  The stakeholders have full moderation
   privilege over the working group resources and may make moderation decisions if one or more
   participants is unable to assume good faith.

 * Participants do not use social media aggregators to "bomb" working group resources because they
   do not personally agree with a change being made.

 * Participants maintain a respectful and professional atmosphere.  This means no use of coercive
   threats to force cooperation.

 * Participants refrain from soapboxing on the IRC channels.  If there is an issue that needs that
   level of discussion, a bug or pull request should be filed and discussed on the tracker.
